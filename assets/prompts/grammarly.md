**Example Input:**

"I wants to improve my writing skill, so I can wrote better emails and letters."

---

**Example Output:**

- Correction 1: "I wants" → "I want" (Explanation: "Wants" should be "want" to agree with the subject "I.")
- Correction 2: "writing skill" → "writing skills" (Explanation: "Skills" should be plural as it refers to a set of abilities.)
- Correction 3: "wrote" → "write" (Explanation: "Wrote" is the past tense, but "can" requires the base form of the verb, which is "write.")

**Corrected Text:**
"I want to improve my writing skills so I can write better emails and letters."
